# Soccer Scores CLI in Node.js

## Getting Started

Clone down this repo and run `npm install`

Type `soccer` into the command line prompt to view the menu.

`soccer version` outputs the version of this application.

`soccer help` outputs the menu.

`soccer scores` outputs the soccer scores to the command line.

## Design

This application consists of two main files, `helperFunctions.js` and `calculateScores.js`

Each function is a discrete unit of code that accomplishes a single task, modeling principles of functional programming. Additionally, unit testing is much easier this way, since the functions have a 1-1 relationship to their tests.

### helperFunctions.js

`helperFunctions.js` contains small helper functions that assist in the calculation of the scores.

`parseTeamNames` uses regex and Sets to return an array of all the team names, as a unique list.

`countTeams`, `countGames`, and `calculateMatchDays` return the number of teams, the number of games, and the number of matchdays, respectively.

`getTopValues` returns the top 3 teams with their scores, and is called in each iteration of the calculate() function to output the scores of the top 3 teams after every round.

`transformData` and `formatObjectToString` are functions that format the data in order to be ingested, or outputted to the console, respectively.

### calculate.js

`calculate.js` is the bulk of the application, and contains the algorithm to calculate the scores after each round takes place.

It makes use of some of the helper functions, and a constant called `startingScores` that is an object with each team's score set to 0 before the iterations begin. This also adds type fidelity, so that numbers are added to numbers inside the loops.

The outer loop contains two variables, `i` and `m`.

`i` increases by 6 each time, since there are 6 teams playing once on a given match day.

Since the input data is already organized by matchday and there is no specific delimiter, the `i` variable in the loop can segment the data 6 teams at a time, or per matchday.

The second variable, `m`, is solely for outputting to the console. It starts at 1 and ends at 4, to capture each matchday.

The inner loop has the variable `j`, which begins at `i`, which represents the start of each match day.

`j` has a limit at 6, and increases by 2 each time. The increase of 2 represents a game, between 2 players.

If the first team inside the inner loop has a higher score, they are awarded 3 points and the second team is awarded 0 points.
If first & second teams inside the inner loop are tied, each team is awarded 1 point.
If the second team inside the inner loop as a higher score, they are awarded 3 points and the first team is awarded 0 points.

After each iteration of the inner loop, which can be equated to a match day, the `formatObjectToString` and `getTopValues` run on the cumulative scores object to output it to the console. The `formatObjectToString` function takes an object and returns a string. The `getTopValues` function returns only the top 3 teams & their scores.

## Tests

Run `npm test` to run the test suites.

## Further Improvements

While this accomplishes the task, an improvement would be a test data generator that can rapidly create more test data to increase the fidelity of the tests. Another improvement could be the extraction of the regex functions to a separate file. To make this application more dynamic, relying less on hard coded solutions, parts of the code could be abstracted or refactored to accept additional types of data, or data files in different formats.

### Initial Configuration Notes

1. I created a package.json, index.js, and a bin -> soccer directory. I added the following to the soccer file within bin to make it executable:

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
require('../')()
```

I ran `chmod +x bin/soccer` to allow the bin file to be run. Then, I ran `npm link` at the root of the project to access it anywhere by referring to it as `soccer`
